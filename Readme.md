Cynthia Johnson is a planned puzzle game in which the player assumes the role of Cynthia Johnson (duh!), an adventurer who goes into deep ruins and has to solve puzzles to find the prize she is looking for.
The planning is that Cynthia Johnson is going to combine elements of many well known puzzle games which Cynthia has to tackle in order to make her way to the next puzzle. 
There will not be much of a story. Cynthia is just the mascotte to put the game in a more adventure like setting to give it some ambience. The number of puzzles is not yet known, and what realms Cynthia will get herself into isn't known either.

### Technobabble:
Cynthia Johnson requires the "[LOVE2D](http://love2d.org)" engine to run.
BUT! Don't just mindlessly put all the files in this repository together in a .love file, as I tell ya, the game won't work at all that way.
- First of all, all third party assets have NOT been included, to avoid copyright issues.
- Second, this code requires a pre-processor called [BuildLove](https://github.com/Tricky1975/BuildLove). I know it can be quite a chore configuring that tool, but once it works, it works :)
- Third, you need my [libraries](https://github.com/LuaLibs/Love-Lua-Libraries). Once the BuildLove tool is properly configured it will automatically import the libraries it needs for this project and ignore those which are not needed.

Well if you got good replacements for the missing assets (you can check the credits.md file. Everything not credited under my name (Jeroen P. Broks) is not in this repository either, you can start building using the love builder. It currently only fully builds for Mac and Windows, although it creates a love file for linux users to use. Android support is currently not complete, and iOS support will very likely never happen aside from creating a "dedicated" iOS love file, but due to Apple's strict AppStore policy on iOS I'm not interested in releasing for iOS. Sorry!
