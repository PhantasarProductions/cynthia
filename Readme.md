Cynthia Johnson is a planned puzzle game in which the player assumes the role of Cynthia Johnson (duh!), an adventurer who goes into deep ruins and has to solve puzzles to find the prize she is looking for.
The planning is that Cynthia Johnson is going to combine elements of many well known puzzle games which Cynthia has to tackle in order to make her way to the next puzzle. 
There will not be much of a story. Cynthia is just the mascotte to put the game in a more adventure like setting to give it some ambience. The number of puzzles is not yet known, and what realms Cynthia will get herself into isn't known either.
