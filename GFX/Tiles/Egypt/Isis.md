The wall Isis is depicted upon was drawn by Jeroen P. Broks
The version without her picture is as thus (c) by Jeroen P. Broks and under the same CC license as all other pictures.
The picture of Isis came from Jeff Dahl who licened it under a GNU General Documentation License, and thus the wall pictures in which Isis is depicted do automatically fall under the same license as perscribed.
Of course the game as a whole was already a GNU GPL3 licenced production, from the start, and this Isis picture doesn't threaten that status.
