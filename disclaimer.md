# Disclaimer

Cynthia Johnson is an entirely fictional character and she is not based on anybody at all.
Same goes for any other characters that might appear in the game.
If you find any resemblance to real people, either dead or living, it's purely coincidental.

The only exception may go to some historical persons (the Greek philosopher Plato is mentioned in the game for example, but how could he be left out, since the story revolved around Atlantis). :-P
